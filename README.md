INTRODUCTION

This exploration takes the Red Wine Quality data set and analysis some aspects of it.

This tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).Some variables are: fixed acidity, residual sugar, density, alcohol and quality.

The first thing to do after a previous analysis of the data is make some questions: What is the main feature of the analisys? What is the secondaries features of the analisys? How they relatad with each other (main and secondaries features)? Which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?
